# Java Projects Repository  

This repository contains two Java-based projects that demonstrate fundamental programming concepts, including Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA).  

## Projects  

### 1. **Tic-Tac-Toe (DSA-Based Project)**  
A simple command-line Tic-Tac-Toe game where two players take turns marking a 3x3 board until a player wins or the game ends in a tie.  

**Features:**  
- Two-player mode with user input validation.  
- Displays the board after every move.  
- Detects win conditions and announces the winner.  
- Ensures valid moves and prevents overwriting existing marks.
