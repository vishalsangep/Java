# Payroll Management System (Java OOP)  

This is a simple Java-based Payroll Management System demonstrating Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. It allows adding, removing, and displaying employee details while calculating salaries for both full-time and part-time employees.  

## Features  
- Implements **abstraction** and **inheritance** with `Employee`, `FullTimeEmployee`, and `PartTimeEmployee` classes.  
- Stores employee details using an **ArrayList**.  
- Calculates salaries dynamically based on employee type.  
- Provides an interactive **menu-driven system** for managing employees.  

## How to Run  
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/payroll-system-java.git
   ```  
2. Compile the Java files:  
   ```sh
   javac Main.java
   ```  
3. Run the program:  
   ```sh
   java oops.Main
   ```  

## Usage  
- Add **full-time** or **part-time** employees.  
- Remove employees by **ID**.  
- Display all employees along with their calculated salaries.  
- Exit the program when done.
